## 3. Implementation Details

### Technical Background
Player tracking systems typically employ either pure motion-based tracking or appearance-based re-identification. Our approach combines both, similar to [relevant papers would be cited here], while adding novel optimizations for real-time performance.

![Player Tracking Results](tracking_results.png)
*Figure 2: Real-time player tracking results from a Premier League match (Manchester City vs Manchester United, 80:55). Each player is assigned a unique colored bounding box with an ID number. The system successfully maintains player identities through occlusions and interactions. Note the accurate tracking despite similar appearances (team uniforms) and varying player poses. The frame demonstrates successful handling of both dense player groups and isolated players across the field.*

### 3.1 Feature Extraction and Matching

#### 3.1.1 Appearance Feature Extraction
```python
class FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = resnet50(pretrained=True)
        self.backbone = nn.Sequential(*list(self.backbone.children())[:-1])
        self.fc = nn.Linear(2048, 512)  # Dimension reduction
        
    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.backbone(x)
        features = features.view(features.size(0), -1)
        return self.fc(features)
```

#### 3.1.2 Feature Matching Strategy
- Cosine similarity computation
- Temporal feature aggregation
- Adaptive threshold selection:
```python
def compute_similarity(feat1, feat2):
    sim = torch.cosine_similarity(feat1, feat2)
    weight = temporal_weight(feat1_time, feat2_time)
    return sim * weight
```

### 3.2 Track Management

#### 3.2.1 Track Initialization and Update
```python
class Track:
    def __init__(self, bbox, feature):
        self.kalman = initialize_kalman()
        self.features = FeatureHistory(max_size=50)
        self.missed_frames = 0
        self.update(bbox, feature)
        
    def update(self, bbox, feature):
        self.kalman.update(bbox)
        self.features.add(feature)
        self.missed_frames = 0
```

#### 3.2.2 Lost Track Recovery
- Feature-based re-identification
- Temporal consistency checking
- Confidence scoring system

### 3.3 Performance Optimizations

#### 3.3.1 Batch Processing
```python
def process_batch(frames, batch_size=4):
    features = []
    for i in range(0, len(frames), batch_size):
        batch = frames[i:i+batch_size]
        batch_features = feature_extractor(batch)
        features.extend(batch_features)
    return features
```
